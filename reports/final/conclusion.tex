\section{Conclusion an Future Work}
The three algorithms used in this paper almost surely cover the
span of various flavors of approximation algorithms used in all graphical model
estimation. There are other approximation algorithms such as loopy belief
propagation for general graphs but these are variants of the algorithms covered
in this work~\ref{Heskes02}

Sampling performs
comparatively better than the other approximate inference schemes on all datasets

    But sampling has many parameters to be tuned

    Variational schemes are sensitive to step size of the ascent while optimizing

    MCMC based sampling is slower than most variational inference (except delta method).
    But can be fast when there is good mixing in the chains

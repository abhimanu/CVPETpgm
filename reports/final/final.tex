\begin{abstract}
We present a comparative study of various approximation algorithms present in
the literature for probabilistic graphical model inference and estimation. There
is a dilemma in considerable number of research populace regarding the choice
of the approach for estimating graphical model parameters. There is no hard and
fast rule as to when to use what. We attempt to present here an empirical study of
various approximation algorithm, especially the big two: sampling based
and variational based, in use for graphical model learning. Though our model for
learning is restricted to Bayesian logistuic regression it does present a
consoderable challege since there is non-conjugacy due to presence of sigmoid
function for the label prediction. We presnt clever ways to work-around such
situation in variational as well as sampling methods. We analyze the algorithms
on a diverse set of datasets as well as present run time results for speed
comparison.

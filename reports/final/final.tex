\begin{abstract}
We present a comparative study of various approximation algorithms present in
the literature for probabilistic graphical model inference and estimation. There
is a dilemma in a considerable number of research populace regarding the choice
of the estimation algorithm for graphical models. There is no hard and
fast rule as to when to use what. We attempt to present here an empirical study of
various approximation algorithms, especially the big two: sampling
and variational based, at present prevalent in graphical model learning
literature.
Though our model for learning is restricted to Bayesian logistic regression it does present a
considerable challege since there is non-conjugacy due to presence of sigmoid
function for the label prediction. It also presents generalizable enough
conclusions regarding the state of affairs in chosing one algorithm over
the other. We present clever ways to work-around the non-cnjugacy in variational as
well as sampling methods. We analyze the algorithms on a diverse set 
of datasets. We present run time results for speed comparison among the
different approximation techniques.

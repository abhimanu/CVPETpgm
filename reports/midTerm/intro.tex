Graphical models have been extensively used in recent decades in thebroader research area of machine learning: from linguistics to network discovery andstructure prediction in parsers to online social media~\cite{Koller+Friedman:09}Graphical models provide a convenient way of  representing complex structures.They are a great tool to represent data which has an intuitive generativeor a causal story~\cite{GettingStarted}. In most of these cases we areestimating the parameters of the probabilistic model where some of the membernodes of the graphs are not observed or hidden. Models like these are also veryuseful in the cases when one has a causal story where there are hidden states ofthe in the causal chain for e.g. hidden markov model~\cite{Baum1967}. Graphicalmodelling is one of the most effective way to estimate models that involvetransitions over a state space e.g. temporal modelling\cite{Arnold:2007:TCM:1281192.1281203}. There have been various methodsproposed for estimating parameters of such a model. there have been a lot of extensive analysis of these models in terms of the
